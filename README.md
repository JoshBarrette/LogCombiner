# Log Combiner
Combines logs from logs.tf for easier analysis.

Input a name for the log, the map(s), log files (ex: https://logs.tf/3386922), and your api key (found at https://logs.tf/uploader).

## TODO
 - Instead of just having 4 set log input boxes, start with 2 and add a + and - for adding and removing text boxes as needed.
